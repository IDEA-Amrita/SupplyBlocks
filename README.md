**Project: Supply Blocks - Real-Time Resource Tracking and Availability**

Abstract:

The Supply Blocks project aims to develop a mobile application that enables the local community to track resources in real-time and view their availability. Users can also make requests for resources they require. The project aims to streamline resource management and improve accessibility within the community.

Problem Analysis:

- Problem Statement: The local community lacks an efficient system to track resources and their availability in real-time. This often leads to inefficiencies, delays, and a lack of transparency in accessing necessary resources. There is a need for a mobile application that can provide real-time tracking and availability information to streamline the resource management process.
- Developers required:
    - 3 developers proficient in mobile app development using Flutter.
    - 1 developer with experience in backend development and database management.

Objectives:

1. Collect information from the local community regarding the types of resources to focus on.
2. Develop a mobile application that allows users to track resources in real-time and view their availability.
3. Enable users to request specific resources through the application.
4. Create an intuitive user interface for easy navigation and interaction.
5. Implement a backend system to manage resource data and handle user requests.

Modules:

1. Resource Tracking:
    - Develop a mechanism to track and update the availability of various resources in real-time.
    - Integrate technologies such as GPS or QR codes for accurate tracking.
2. User Requests:
    - Implement a feature that allows users to submit requests for specific resources they require.
    - Manage the requests and provide notifications to relevant stakeholders.
3. User Interface:
    - Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the mobile application.
    - Include features such as resource search, availability status, and request submission.
4. Backend Development:
    - Build a robust backend system to manage resource data, handle user requests, and ensure secure data storage.
    - Utilize suitable technologies such as a database management system.

Duration to work: The estimated duration for the project is four months, considering the complexity of real-time tracking and backend development.

Userbase: The userbase for the Supply Blocks application includes members of the local community who require access to various resources and organizations responsible for resource management.

Architecture: The architecture will consist of a mobile application developed using Flutter for the user interface. The backend will be developed using appropriate technologies for data management and handling user requests. (If needed, provide an architecture diagram.)

Deliverables:

1. Mobile Application (iOS and Android) with Resource Tracking and User Request features.
2. Backend System for data management and request handling.
3. Comprehensive Documentation covering all aspects of the project.
4. Testing and Validation Reports.
5. Deployment and Maintenance Recommendations.

System Development:

Skills/Frameworks required:

- Mobile App Development: Flutter (Dart programming language)
- Backend Development: Node.js, Express, and a suitable database management system (e.g., Firebase, PostgreSQL, MySQL).

Expected Results:

The Supply Blocks project aims to deliver a functional mobile application that enables real-time tracking of resources, displays their availability, and allows users to make resource requests. The project's success will be evaluated based on the seamless integration of frontend and backend systems, user satisfaction, and effective resource management within the local community.

Conclusion:

The Supply Blocks project addresses the need for a mobile application that enables real-time tracking and availability of resources within the local community. By developing an intuitive user interface and implementing backend systems, the project aims to streamline resource management and improve accessibility. The expected outcomes include improved resource tracking, efficient request handling, and enhanced user experience.

Future Scope:

1. Integration with external APIs: Connect the application with external systems or APIs to provide more comprehensive resource information, such as prices, reviews, or additional details.
2. User feedback and rating system: Implement a feedback and rating system to gather user reviews and improve the quality of resource availability information.
3. Expansion to other communities: Scale the application to serve multiple communities and regions, enabling wider access to resource tracking and availability information.
